# LeadingLights — OCA Cadet Development Hub

Welcome to **LeadingLights**, the official online hub for the **Office of Cadet Affairs (OCA)**.

This site will eventually serve as a **central dashboard** for:
- Cadet goals per semester (academics, leadership, personal growth)
- Leadership positions & roles held each term
- GWA tracking (midterms and finals)
- 360° leadership evaluations and leadership grades
- Physical fitness data: BMI and PFT scores
- Recognition of Gold, Silver, and Bronze Star holders
- Formation Officer (FO) tools for tracking, mentoring, and coaching

### Vision

To give every MMMA cadet a **clear view of their growth** — not just in academics, but in:
- **Character**
- **Leadership**
- **Physical fitness**
- **Lifeskills**

This repository will power a **GitHub Pages website**, built to be:
- **Free to host**
- **Accessible on any browser**
- **Designed like a university documentation portal**

More sections and features will be added as we build the site structure.
