Our work focuses on the CLAP-L domains:

- **Leadership** – leading self, leading others, and leading teams  
- **Academics Support** – habits, environment, and systems that help cadets succeed  
- **Physical Fitness** – health, strength, and readiness for life at sea  
- **Lifeskills** – people skills, decision-making, and personal responsibility  

OCA partners with **departments, Formation Officers, Fleet Officers, and clubs** to align all these areas.
